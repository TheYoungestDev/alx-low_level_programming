# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Introduction
This repository contains a collection of C programs created as part of the ALX School low-level programming curriculum, specifically for Project 0x01. These programs are designed to teach essential concepts such as variables, conditional statements, loops, and more in the C programming language.

## Concepts Covered
In these projects, we explore the following fundamental concepts:

- Arithmetic operators
- Logical operators (boolean operators)
- Relational operators
- Boolean values (TRUE and FALSE in C)
- If and If...else statements
- Use of comments
- Declaring variables of types char, int, and unsigned int
- Assigning values to variables
- Printing values of variables using `printf`
- Working with the `while` loop
- Utilizing the ASCII character set
- Compiling code with `gcc` flags -m32 and -m64

## Project List
1. **0-positive_or_negative.c**: This program assigns a random number to the variable `n` on each execution and prints whether it's positive, negative, or zero.

2. **1-last_digit.c**: This program assigns a random number to `n` and prints the last digit along with additional information.

3. **2-print_alphabet.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in alphabetical order.

4. **3-print_alphabets.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet followed by the uppercase alphabet.

5. **4-print_alphabt.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e'.

6. **5-print_numbers.c**: This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10, starting from 0.

7. **6-print_numberz.c**: This program prints all single-digit numbers in base 10, starting from 0, without using any variables of type `char`.

8. **7-print_tebahpla.c**: This program prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse order.

9. **8-print_base16.c**: This program prints all numbers of base 16 in lowercase.

10. **9-print_comb.c**: This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers separated by commas and spaces.

## Compilation
To compile any of these programs, you can use the `gcc` compiler with the following flags:

```bash
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 program_name.c -o program_name
